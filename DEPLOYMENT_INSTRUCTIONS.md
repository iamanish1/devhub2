# Free Project Access Control Fix - Deployment Instructions

## Issue
Users are getting 403 "Access Denied" errors when trying to access free project contribution panels because the server is still using old access control logic.

## Changes Made
1. **Updated `checkWorkspaceAccess` function** in `Server/src/controller/ProjectTaskController.js`
2. **Added free project access logic** - any user can now access free projects for resume building
3. **Created helper function** `checkProjectAccess` for consistent access control

## Deployment Required
The changes are currently only in the local codebase. To fix the production issue:

### Option 1: Deploy to Railway (Recommended)
```bash
# In the Server directory
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Allow free project access for all users"
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Manual Server Restart
If using a different deployment method, restart the server after the changes are deployed.

## What the Fix Does
- **Before**: Only project owners and selected contributors could access contribution panels
- **After**: Free projects allow ANY logged-in user to access for resume building

## Testing
After deployment, test by:
1. Going to a free project
2. Clicking "Start Building for Resume"
3. Should successfully access contribution panel without 403 errors

## Additional Notes
- 404 errors for escrow wallet are expected and normal for free projects
- The main issue is the 403 workspace access error, which this fix resolves
